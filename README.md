# Face Recognition

## Project Overview

The **Face Recognition** project uses computer vision techniques to recognize and verify individuals based on their facial features. By collecting and analyzing images of users' faces, this project leverages libraries like OpenCV and Pillow to detect, preprocess, and recognize faces from photos.

## Libraries Used

- **OpenCV**: For face detection and recognition, leveraging robust computer vision algorithms.
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation, including resizing, cropping, and other preprocessing tasks.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**:
  - Captures or loads images of users' faces to create a dataset for recognition.

- **Face Detection**:
  - Detects facial features from images using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers or other pre-trained models.

- **Face Recognition**:
  - Matches detected faces against the stored database of user faces to identify or verify individuals.
